    <h1>About Spark! Bytes</h1>
    <h4>Spark! Bytes was conceived with a simple idea in mind - to minimize food waste and maximize 
        food sharing within the Boston University community. We recognized the potential of connecting
        those who have excess food with those who could benefit from it.</h4>
